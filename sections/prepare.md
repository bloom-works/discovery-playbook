## Plan the sprint collaboratively with the client

### Overview
While the sprint officially begins at the kickoff meeting (in the next section), the engagement manager (EM) or product and delivery manager (PDM) will align with the client on a few things ahead of kickoff.

#### Review the challenge and start drafting your goals

Clear, well-defined goals are critical to a successful sprint. They keep everyone aligned and your scope manageable. Align with the client on these as early as possible‚Äîeven if they need to be broad at this point. Be clear that the challenge statement and goals may evolve as your research unfolds. As you document your goals, make sure to also document any assumptions that are baked into them.

<b>Example challenge:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Why is hiring and recruiting hard for your state?</li>
</ul>

<b>Example sprint goals:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Understand the hiring and recruiting ecosystem</li>
    <li>Learn the barriers in hiring and recruiting from the hiring manager‚Äôs point of view</li>
    <li>Learn barriers from a job seeker‚Äôs point of view</li>
    <li>Assess the online job search and application portal</li>
</ul>

We‚Äôll go more into defining the challenge and goals in  ‚ÄúDive into the problem space‚Äù in Section 2: <a href="../define/">Define</a>.

#### Clarify client roles

These are some roles you‚Äôll want to identify or assign with the client‚Äôs help:
<ul>
    <li><b>Executive sponsor</b> ‚Äî Leader on the client side who endorses the project, aligns it with department strategy, and allocates staff and resources. Approves the project charter and receives and approves final deliverables. Can remove persistent blockers or settle disagreements within the client org.</li>
    <li><b>Sprint champion</b> ‚Äî The main point of contact (POC) with decision and approval authority. Rides with the sprint team, coordinates, and helps make sure the project is successful. Attends meetings and working sessions with the sprint team. Provides input and feedback, represents the client within the sprint team, and consults with the executive sponsor when appropriate. It is particularly helpful if the sprint champion can directly help connect the team with participant recruitment.</li>
    <li><b>Liaisons</b> ‚Äî Day-to-day points of contact that help the sprint team connect with stakeholders, coordinate schedules, access information, and clear blockers. This may be the sprint champion or other people they identify.</li>
    <li><b>Subject matter experts (SMEs)</b> ‚Äî Frontline or program staff. They provide insight into department processes, data and workflows, communication activities, and technology.</li>
</ul>

#### Gather existing information and data

If there‚Äôs alignment on the goals, you can start to ask the client for background data, previous research, and documentation such as organization (org) charts and relevant legislation. This information can help clarify which stakeholders will need to be part of the kickoff and the research process overall, particularly for recruitment.

#### Create a project brief

A project brief is a place to capture foundational project information.  This document defines core information about the project and makes sure you and your clients are on the same page before you begin. A project brief should include these things: 

<ul>
    <li>The sprint challenge</li>
    <li>The goals of the sprint</li>
    <li>Key members of the client‚Äôs organization who will be working closely with the sprint team</li>
    <li>Timeline</li>
    <li>How you‚Äôll connect with participants who are the audience of a service or program</li>
</ul>

Share it with your client to make sure you all are in sync. In that same conversation, go over each team‚Äôs values and expectations. 

üí° <b>Tip:</b> Agile project management and human-centered design methods may be new for the client, and will require some socialization and training. Keep in mind that this method of working and the pace of the sprint may be an adjustment for the client.

## Align the team on roles and expectations

### Overview

A successful sprint team is well-rounded and diverse. It has defined roles and responsibilities. The life cycle of a sprint is typically short (less than 8 weeks), so it‚Äôs critical that every team member understands:
- where they fit on the team (their role or roles)
- what‚Äôs expected of them (duties, allocated hours, etc), and 
- who they need to go to (and for what)

While you need to define responsibilities, sprint teams are usually small (3 to 7 people). This means roles are more fluid than a traditional project team. Sprint team members often contribute in areas they may not own. For example, all team members take part in research interviews. An engineer may do service design ‚Äî like make a user journey map, or map out front or back stage processes. Or, a designer may moderate an interview.

The whole team is responsible for the final package of recommendations and artifacts. Findings will often overlap disciplines. Recommendations will require input from multiple subject matter experts (SMEs) along the way. We love this and it makes our work better.

The roles and responsibilities on sprint teams typically look like this:
- **Engagement manager (EM)** ‚Äî Works with the client to arrange the sprint. Assembles the sprint team. Checks in with the team to make sure the project is on track and the team has enough support. 
- **Sprint team lead** ‚Äî Manages the team and helps settle decisions. Often, but not always, this is the product and delivery manager. This can also be the EM.
- **Product and delivery manager (PDM)** ‚Äî Tracks the overall vision and approach for the project. Manages the work and deliverables.
- **Researcher** ‚Äî Defines the research methods and leads the research activities and synthesis.
- **Designer** ‚Äî Translates findings into tangible, understandable products, services, or recommendations.
- **Tech strategist** ‚Äî Consults on tech, architecture, and builds prototypes.

{% Checklist %}
- Make sure the team lead and other members are clear on their role and ready to work collaboratively

## Orient the team in an internal kickoff

### Overview

The internal kickoff is an early project activity designed to ensure that before work kicks off in earnest, the internal team clearly understands the purpose and goals of the project. This is the time to establish a shared understanding of the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of the sprint, and establish what needs to be accomplished during the sprint.

It is also a moment to set the conditions for collaboration, and to learn about each other‚Äôs work and communication styles. It‚Äôs important to remember that, **while we‚Äôre doing this work for humans, everyone on the team is _also human_**. Keep this notion front and center. It will provide support during times that feel stressful and guard against burnout.

Immediately after the internal kickoff, start scheduling big project milestones and project rituals such as daily standups and weekly syncs and retros.

These are the goals of the internal kickoff:
- Get everyone acquainted with each other and learn about team work styles
- Develop more clarity on purpose, roles, and responsibilities
- Align on the sprint project goals, scope, and tools

#### Onboard the team
To set the sprint up for success, build cohesion and get clear about the rhythms and norms before the sprint begins. Create an onboarding guide to orient sprint team members. It should include key project documents and core policies on topics like travel and time tracking. Team members could create a ‚Äú<a href="https://friday.app/p/personal-user-manual-for-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">User manual</a>‚Äù for themselves with these items:
- Preferred communication and work styles
- Strengths and areas of growth
- Personal fun facts
- Anything else the rest of the team needs to know to get ready for the collaborative work to come

Team members can fill this out before or during the internal kickoff.

#### Coordinate logistics

The team should establish core working hours. These are when everyone on the team is online and responsive to communications. Keep a group calendar to ensure visibility for key project milestones and deadlines. That calendar can also track team members‚Äô availability. Everyone should have access to core project tools such as Google Drive, Slack, and Asana (or similar project management tools). That includes client team members who may have tasks assigned to them or need visibility into work progress.

#### Set up rituals

Discovery sprints follow agile methodology. Teams should be familiar with and make use of these agile rituals and norms:
- Standups
- Weekly planning meetings
- Weekly retros
- Kanban-style project management tools

These are all tools to help the team learn, iterate, and stay in sync. They also help the teams stay integrated, especially when people work remotely. Foster a culture of continuous learning and feedback by holding regular (weekly or every two week) team retros and making sure team members feel comfortable communicating. Don‚Äôt forget to make space for frequent kudos and celebrations!

{% Checklist %}
- Create and share onboarding guides
- Set up and facilitate internal project kickoff
- Prepare ‚Äúuser manuals‚Äù for the team to fill out
- Decide on internal sprint tools with team members and agree on their use 
- Review the project brief and what we know about the project, problem statement, and client so far
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- What abilities and skills ‚Äì including practice areas, languages, technologies - do you have that will help?
- What are possible weaknesses?
- What are your personal goals and hopes for how this project will run?
- How will you pivot as a team?
- What do you want to achieve and how will you measure success?
