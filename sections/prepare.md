Often called ‚ÄúWeek 0.‚Äù In this section, we‚Äôll go over how to:
<ul>
    <li>Plan the sprint collaboratively with the client</li>
    <li>Align the team on roles and expectations</li>
    <li>Orient the team in an internal kickoff</li>
</ul>

## Plan the sprint collaboratively with the client

### Overview
While the sprint officially begins at the kickoff meeting (in the next section), the engagement manager (EM) or product and delivery manager (PDM) will align with the client on a few things ahead of kickoff.

#### Review the challenge and start drafting your goals

Clear, well-defined goals are critical to a successful sprint. They keep everyone aligned and your scope manageable. Align with the client on these as early as possible‚Äîeven if they need to be broad at this point. Be clear that the challenge statement and goals may evolve as your research unfolds. As you document your goals, make sure to also document any assumptions that are baked into them.

<b>Example challenge:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Why is hiring and recruiting hard for your state?</li>
</ul>

<b>Example sprint goals:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Understand the hiring and recruiting ecosystem</li>
    <li>Learn the barriers in hiring and recruiting from the hiring manager‚Äôs point of view</li>
    <li>Learn barriers from a job seeker‚Äôs point of view</li>
    <li>Assess the online job search and application portal</li>
</ul>

We‚Äôll go more into defining the challenge and goals in  ‚ÄúDive into the problem space‚Äù in Section 2: <a href="../define/">Define</a>.

#### Clarify client roles

These are some roles you‚Äôll want to identify or assign with the client‚Äôs help:
<ul>
    <li><b>Executive sponsor</b> ‚Äî Leader on the client side who endorses the project, aligns it with department strategy, and allocates staff and resources. Approves the project charter and receives and approves final deliverables. Can remove persistent blockers or settle disagreements within the client org.</li>
    <li><b>Sprint champion</b> ‚Äî The main point of contact (POC) with decision and approval authority. Rides with the sprint team, coordinates, and helps make sure the project is successful. Attends meetings and working sessions with the sprint team. Provides input and feedback, represents the client within the sprint team, and consults with the executive sponsor when appropriate. It is particularly helpful if the sprint champion can directly help connect the team with participant recruitment.</li>
    <li><b>Liaisons</b> ‚Äî Day-to-day points of contact that help the sprint team connect with stakeholders, coordinate schedules, access information, and clear blockers. This may be the sprint champion or other people they identify.</li>
    <li><b>Subject matter experts (SMEs)</b> ‚Äî Frontline or program staff. They provide insight into department processes, data and workflows, communication activities, and technology.</li>
</ul>

#### Gather existing information and data

If there‚Äôs alignment on the goals, you can start to ask the client for background data, previous research, and documentation such as organization (org) charts and relevant legislation. This information can help clarify which stakeholders will need to be part of the kickoff and the research process overall, particularly for recruitment.

#### Create a project brief

A project brief is a place to capture foundational project information.  This document defines core information about the project and makes sure you and your clients are on the same page before you begin. A project brief should include: 

<ul>
    <li>The sprint challenge,</li>
    <li>the goals of the sprint,</li>
    <li>key members of the client‚Äôs organization who will be working closely with the sprint team,</li>
    <li>timeline,  and</li>
    <li>how you‚Äôll connect with participants who are the audience of a service or program.</li>
</ul>

Share it with your client to make sure you all are in sync. In that same conversation, go over each team‚Äôs values and expectations. 

üí° <b>Tip:</b> Agile project management and human-centered design methods may be new for the client, and will require some socialization and training. Keep in mind that this method of working and the pace of the sprint may be an adjustment for the client.
