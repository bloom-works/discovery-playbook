## Kick off the project with the client

### Overview

Now that the sprint team is all on the same page (thanks, internal kickoff!), we shift our focus to getting the client on board with our plan. This is called the project kickoff.

The kickoff meeting marks the official start of the discovery sprint. It's the first time the full sprint team and the client come together to discuss the goals and logistics of the sprint.

Encourage any client stakeholders to attend who have the potential to block or help the project. They all need to be aware of the timeline, goals, and expected participation. The whole team, especially those outside the core sprint team, should hear from the executive sponsor or the sprint champion about their endorsement of this effort and commitment to the timeline and goals. This is the top priority of this step. It sets up future engagement with internal stakeholders whose perspective(s) will be crucial to the success of the sprint.

It‚Äôs also an ideal moment to revisit and refine the challenge. Don't only present the challenge statement. Present the goals, assumptions, and framing. This larger group will often have great insight to help you reassess the landscape around the issue. 

üí° **Tip:** Kicking off a project with a strong start is crucial to success. Misalignment on critical factors such as overall vision, desired outcomes, client engagement, research track strategy, and work approach can cause many issues in the future. That could include research delays, burdensome coordination, and poor team performance. 

To reduce these risks, consider some of these well-designed activities: 
- Engage in **team builder games** to establish personal connections and positive team dynamics
- Introduce Bloom‚Äôs approach to discovery sprints, and explain the philosophy behind human-centered design research methods and agile project management 
- Perform a structured **brainstorming exercise** in which everyone diverges and converges on the vision and goals for the project
- **Collaboratively map out key stakeholders** ‚Äî who they are and how to engage with them
- Conduct a **pre-mortem** exercise where we‚Äôll imagine that the project has failed and explore all the reasons why, as a way to identify key risks we need to manage

{% Checklist %}
For the product and delivery manager (PDM):
<br>
- Set up and facilitate client kickoff and brainstorming activities
- Identify any other connected efforts and teams (for example business process work, tech modernization efforts), and how they might affect the clients‚Äô bandwidth
- Follow up after the kickoff to check in with the executive sponsor or the sprint champion about their endorsement of this effort and commitment to the timeline and goals
- Make sure the team has access to the clients‚Äô tools and ecosystem
{%- endChecklist -%}

{% Checklist %}
For the full sprint team:
<br>
- Identify stakeholders, roles, and power dynamics that will affect this sprint and its outcomes
- Identify risks and blockers in a pre-mortem exercise
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- How are you going to involve different stakeholders during the sprint?
- Does the client already have a solution in mind?
- How much does the client want to be involved? Do they want to learn how to do this work themselves? This might look like ‚Äúride-alongs‚Äù to experience Bloom‚Äôs work approach and learn about human-centered design and agile methodologies (for example they could observe an interview or view how some artifacts are created).
{% endKeyQuestions %}

## Dive into the problem space

### Overview

Time to immerse yourself in the problem space! This is where we ramp up the curiosity, digging into the nooks and crannies of the area we‚Äôre researching. It‚Äôs important to go in with an open mind. We‚Äôre here to understand the issue, its root causes, and identify opportunities ‚Äî not solve it. Yet. :D

If you haven‚Äôt already, you should get familiar with the:
- Audiences (internal, external), and how this issue impacts their lives
- Clients and stakeholders (who‚Äôs in charge, who‚Äôs making decisions, and who‚Äôs involved in the project)
- Current ecosystem (where does the problem live, what medium, what tech is involved)
- Any important business requirements, such as policies, laws, program rules
- Current activities and political pushes around the challenge area
- Any and all existing data, research, or artifacts

There are **many** exercises and workshops that can help you get your head wrapped around the problem, including these:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.mural.co/blog/intro-assumptions-mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assumption mapping</a> ‚Äî an activity to unpack and interrogate assumptions about the project</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.mural.co/templates/abstraction-laddering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abstract laddering</a> ‚Äî a strategy to refocus your problem statement through broadening and narrowing it</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.lean.org/lexicon-terms/5-whys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five Whys</a> ‚Äî repeatedly asking ‚Äúwhy‚Äù to identify a root cause</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-might-we-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How-Might-We questions</a> ‚Äî a way to frame questions to unlock direction</li>
    <li>Workshop and facilitation plans <a href="https://miro.com/miroverse/problem-framing-workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like this problem framing workshop</a> to engage stakeholders in framing the problem</li>
    <li>Creating (proto) personas, journey maps, and user stories to articulate user experiences (think of these as initial hypotheses, based on quick evidence or understanding; they should be refined with research and should not be used for solutioning)</li>
    <li><a href="https://lindsayangelo.com/thinkingcont/hypothesis-driven-problem-solving-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Develop problem hypotheses</a></li>
    <li>...and never underestimate the incredible power of desk research!</li>
</ul>

All of this helps you frame the challenge ahead, and acts as a gut check to make sure you‚Äôre not going in the wrong direction. When the team feels confident in their understanding of the space y‚Äôall are operating in, it‚Äôs time to develop a research plan!

At this stage you also want to make sure you have an organized way to capture and document what you‚Äôre discovering.

#### A well-defined problem statement

Discovery sprints involve a lot of set-up work. This is because **a well-defined problem statement is the difference between a successful sprint and just talking to people**. You‚Äôre spending time defining the north star (albeit, one that could shift) that will guide your sprint activities. A well-defined problem:
- Focuses on humans at the center (both users AND staff)
- Provokes curiosity for more exploration and (eventual) solutioning (‚ÄúHow might we‚Ä¶‚Äù questions are great at this)
- Focuses on the challenge, not on the solution (i.e., "How might we implement X" is NOT a good problem statement)
- Expresses insight and perspective about what is difficult or challenging right now, not generally
- Strikes a balance between being actionable and specific, while being open-ended and aspirational (for example: "how might we help residents compost more" rather than "how might our city become zero-waste")
- Is open to change based on what we learn

{% Checklist %}
For the full sprint team:
<br />
- Stay curious
- Align on a shared understanding of the problem space
- Identify an initial ‚Äúnorth star‚Äù problem statement
- Identify all the key players (participant groups to talk to and stakeholders) related to the research problem, and develop at least an initial idea of how they relate to the problem
- Document knowledge gaps to help frame the research to come
- Validate an understanding of the challenge space with the client (but keep in mind that the client has their own biases!)
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- What is the central problem you want to solve? Who is at the center of it? 
- What could you be assuming or overlooking?
- What has been tried in the past? Are there efforts underway in another part of the organization we should know about and learn from?
- Who has a stake in this project? What is their awareness and perspective on this project?
- Are there existing, ongoing efforts that relate to this project, that you should know about? For example, are there strategic planning projects, other consulting engagements, procurements, or other contractors?
- What action-forcing events are on the horizon? For example, are there any known reporting deadlines, audits, media attention, or legislative attention?  
- Is there a need to pull in subject matter experts (SMEs) not currently on the team?
{% endKeyQuestions %}

## Develop the research plan and supporting materials

### Overview

The research plan is a comprehensive document that covers all aspects of the research project.

The plan is also an essential tool to get buy-in from the client. It's how they understand and review the research process before you begin. This is even more important with clients who are less familiar with human-centered design methods.

#### What to include

A research plan should include:
- Background and research goals
- Research questions
- Objectives
- Success criteria
- Ideal participants and recruiting strategy
- Methods and logistics (these will depend on what you‚Äôre trying to discover and your constraints)
- Expected artifacts or outputs from the research (for example a report, a 2-pager research summary, journey maps, etc)
- Timelines

You may set out with an initial list of participants and, after a couple of conversations, realize you need to talk to a different segment of people. Set checkpoints in the recruitment and data collection process to make sure you‚Äôre speaking to the right people. Leave extra time in case you need to conduct extra research. Make sure you share back any changes to the client to keep them up to speed.

üí° **Tip:** If the client is helping recruit participants, ask them to make warm introductions to the right people so we can source interview participants in our short time frame.

{% endKeyQuestions %}

### Begin recruiting research participants

### Overview

Recruiting participants includes many considerations around access, communications, and scheduling. You can't start thinking about logistics early enough in the research process.

It‚Äôs often easier to arrange time to interview stakeholders and internal users than it is to find and schedule participants from the public. Your research plan should address this and inform your recruiting strategy.

#### Research Logistics

The difficulty of reaching participants and how you connect with them will drive the time, effort, and budget you need for recruitment. Getting participants scheduled can take time, and require approvals and follow-ups. That's especially true if you can't connect with them directly. Consider the drop-out and take-up rate you expect for your population when setting timelines. It can also be helpful to create contingency plans ahead of time in case you aren‚Äôt able to get the number of participants you need. Build all these considerations and potential blockers into project timelines. 

It's helpful to assign 1 to 2 team members to manage your participant logistics. That includes monitoring these things:
- Recruitment
- Participation
- Communication
- Scheduling
- Sending out compensation
- Any follow-ups

These team members will also need to juggle the team‚Äôs schedules to make sure everyone has an opportunity to participate.

üí° **Tip:** Have everyone on the team set up a tool like Google Calendar Appointment Schedules or Calendly. These tools can plug directly into each team member's calendar. Set up predetermined blocks of time in which participants can self-book. Set a limit on the number of research engagements each day (for 1-hour sessions, we recommend up to 3 per person per day) and build in buffer time for debriefing and bio breaks.

#### Manage recruitment

There are a few ways to manage participant recruitment: 

1. **The sprint team directly recruits participants**. The sprint team may already have a list of contacts to engage in research. Or, the team develops recruitment materials and a screener to build a list of potential research participants.
2. **The client supports recruitment**. You may need to go through clients or their contacts to get access to potential participants. This can be helpful when clients can provide personalized introductions. Consider how much time you will need to get clients to review, sign off, or send recruitment materials on your behalf.
3. **Hiring a recruitment firm**. Complicated recruits, specific audience requirements, and lack of resources can all add challenges to the recruitment. If accessing participants is difficult, consider working with a firm to manage this part of the process for you. This will add large costs and firms will also need a couple of weeks lead time. If you think you need a firm, you should plan this with your client very early in the process. Using firms is not common during discovery sprints due to their brief nature.

#### Consider your participants

Be mindful of research participants from underserved or over-researched populations. Consider how you will access these groups, what their risks or participation are, and how you can reduce any harms you might cause. Plan for varied language and accessibility needs of the participants you‚Äôll be engaging with. These are some additional approaches to consider:
- Design screeners that have questions to screen out ineligible participants. 
- Explain up front what data you are collecting, why you are collecting it, and how that data will be used and protected. Avoid probing into unnecessary details about people‚Äôs lives.
- Whenever possible, compensate people well for their time and perspective.

#### Research fraud and bots

Incentivized research can attract scammers and bots. These scammers sign up for research studies in bulk to harvest incentives. When designing screeners and surveys, consider how widely they will be distributed.

To help mitigate this, you can create distinct links for different parties distributing the screeners or surveys, <a href="https://www.snapsurveys.com/support-snapxmp/snapxmp/adding-a-captcha-style-question/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and include a CAPTCHA question</a>.
