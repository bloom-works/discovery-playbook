## Be curious and collect data

### Overview

It's time to dive into conducting the research itself. We focus on interviews in this section, but there are several ways to collect data‚Äîlike desk research and literature review, group workshops, surveys, co-designing, and others.

#### Engage the full team in the interview process

Regardless of their role, all sprint team members can be involved in research interviews. If you have subject matter experts, you may consider having them co-develop moderation guides or lead interviews. For example, it might be helpful to have someone with a quantitative data background lead and design interviews with data teams. For folks new to interviewing, being an assistant note taker is a good introduction to the process.

#### Get consent from the participant

It's essential to have participants provide consent before conversing. Consent should be both verbal and written. Cross-check that the participant consents to the interview before starting the formal conversation. Some examples from previous projects include a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDKNDCK_9mc3GKBy0ZeKnKeC5XHjg8WUzyvHHc0Ya83AvyvA/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual interview consent form</a>.

#### Record the session if you can

Recording can be strictly voice, or also include video. This makes it easier to refer back to the interviews and accurately document the participant‚Äôs perspective. There may be instances where it's not appropriate to record, like if the participant requested not to be recorded. If you are working with a client who‚Äôs participating in the interviews, check with your client to see if they have preferred tools.

**A note on recording:** When interviewing stakeholders or internal users who have a relationship to the client, they may be hesitant to be put ‚Äúon the record.‚Äù Make it clear (and make it so) where you‚Äôll store the recordings, and that their names will never be associated with what they share in the interview unless permission is requested and granted.

#### Conduct the interview with kindness and curiosity

This is where your research planning starts to gain momentum. You are having direct conversations with people. Remember to stay curious and use the best practices for interviewing people, such as:
- Don't ask leading questions
- Ask open-ended questions and follow up questions
- Allow for thinking time with comfortable silences
- Ask if they have any questions
- Thank them for their time and have clear next steps for those receiving compensation.

#### Take good notes

Ideally, there are at least 2 sprint team members in the research session, so one person can lead the discussion and the other person can take notes. If you are solo and the session is recorded, you can skip notetaking during the session and pull detailed notes from the recording after the session.

Remember to document what the participant thinks and says and not your interpretation of the problem space. How do they approach or experience a topic emotionally and intellectually? What non-verbal cues are conveyed in the conversation? What do you want to follow up on now or later through other research means?

It's important to decide as a team on your note-taking approach during research. Picking the same note-taking method as a team will make it easier to compare and review research. These are some options:
- Bullet form in a document
- Group note-taking in a collaborative document (like Google Docs)
- Narrative form in a document
- Post-it notes on an online whiteboarding tool (like Figjam)
- Spreadsheets for structured interviews or usability tests

üí° **Tip:** Slack provides transcription for video files. If you record in Zoom or Meet, you can drop the video file into your private personal Slack channel (or in a research channel if you have consent to share the recording with other researchers). Then you can jump around the recording via the machine transcription.

#### Debrief

In a debrief, the team will convene to review a recent interview or collection of interviews. This is an essential part of aligning on insights and sharing knowledge. Decide as a team what the method and cadence of debriefing will be. These are some options:
- Scheduling a 30-minute time block immediately after each interview
- Dedicated individual note or reflection sessions writing in Mural or Google Docs
- Scheduling one longer session (45-60 minutes) for the entire day's interviews

It can be helpful to begin debriefs with 5 minutes of quiet reflection. This gives each team member a chance to write down their individual insights about the research before the discussion begins.

Keep your client updated about the status of interviews and roadblocks. The team should decide how to keep clients updated. This could be through emails, weekly or bi-weekly virtual meetings, Slack updates, or Mural logs.

{% Checklist %}
- Create moderator‚Äôs guides for all audience groups
- Conduct dry runs of the interviews, as needed (can have a team member pretend to be an interviewee)
- Create a verbal consent script and a written consent form 
- Determine the tools needed for recording interviews 
- Set up the debrief method and cadence
- Incorporate key research decisions in the agenda at one of the initial team meetings
- Decide how to assign interviewers and note-takers (this can rotate instead of being the same person each time!)
- Discuss what note taking methods and approaches will be used during the sprint
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- How will you maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the participants? 
- What are potential biases in the research?
- How will you address ethical issues that may arise while conducting research? 
- How will you take care of yourself and fellow researchers, particularly when difficult topics arise in interviews?

## Document learnings and share early and often

### Overview

Gathering data can be a time consuming and intensive process. Data and information synthesis doesn‚Äôt need to (and often shouldn‚Äôt!) wait until the end of the project. Debrief information can help inform or drive synthesis, and you can consider this in how you structure your debriefs.

For example, synthesize desk research or participant observation early on. Use this to inform research questions and moderation guides. Synthesize conversations with subject matter experts or organizational leaders to inform future data collection. Here's how that could look:
- Free association: 5 minutes silently writing down main ideas from an interview on a whiteboard, and 15 minutes discussing and affinity mapping (grouping similar items together into helpful themes)
- Create a quadrant highlighting topic areas from the moderation guide you want to capture notes on

Set up rituals that will be helpful for building collective knowledge as a team. Those rituals will bring teammates who are not in data collection activities closer to the information. These could be small Slack updates on key points learned after interviews, a short update at the end of the day, or team-wide daily or weekly debriefs.

Keep clients in the loop by sharing bite-sized summaries of quotes, clips (with participant permission), or learnings as you conduct research.

Here are some ways to share learnings:
- Bite sized share-outs (this could just be a small summary of the interview over Slack)
- <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MmHCaJ_i6kWxu-63lAmNtFs7ix5Wk13r/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debrief framework</a>
- Weekly update with insights

{% Checklist %}
- While debriefing after interviews, document highlightable quotes, questions, and early ideas or hunches
- Document and take notes or sketches of your early ideas and ways your knowledge of the problem is growing
- Set up and manage platforms and tools for ongoing documentation of learnings 
- Provide the client with regular updates about the data as it is being gathered (like weekly updates), don‚Äôt hold all your learnings for the end of the project!
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- How is your understanding of the problem space evolving? 
- What trends are you seeing? 
- Are you talking to the right people and asking the right questions? Do you need to adjust your approaches and questions to understand the problem?
- What ideas or hypotheses are developing about the problem space?
