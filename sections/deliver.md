## Present your findings

### Overview

Ideally, you have been keeping your client informed throughout the sprint.The final presentation, however, is your opportunity to tell your story to clients and external stakeholders. This is a time to discuss what you‚Äôve learned, get aligned on next steps, and to help clients maintain momentum after you've moved on. We often record this presentation, and offer it as a deliverable.

The presentation should cover:
- the problem statement,
- how you addressed it,
- what you found in your discovery research and your conclusions,
- how you came to your conclusions, and
- your recommendations for next steps (and what is required to make the recommendations happen).

Start with your goals for the presentation to get people aligned on what you‚Äôre going to cover. Center the people involved in your research by sharing stories and quotes that reinforce your message. Showing is always more powerful than telling.

{% Checklist %}
For the product and delivery manager (PDM):
<br>
- Identify key stakeholders, for example those who could be involved in future phases of work that follow the discovery phase (like implementation)
- Pre-schedule the presentation to make sure the client and key stakeholders can attend: aim for 60-90 minutes
- Schedule a dry run with the team to nail down hand offs, timing, and presentation flow
{% endChecklist %}

{% Checklist %}
For the researcher or person presenting the deliverable:
<br>
- Leverage tools to best convey your story ‚Äî it may be a slide deck, but it could be live prototypes or videos
- Keep slides concise so they‚Äôre easier to follow, and provide context to which section you‚Äôre currently in
- Keep the presentation focused ‚Äî you can always add an appendix with all the extra artifacts at the end or in a separate doc
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- How will you organize the presentation experience? Is it online or in person? Will you use a slide deck or set up a journey through artifacts?
- Are the narrative and key points in the presentation easy to follow?
- Have you identified critical individuals (stakeholders) that need to be at the presentation?
- Which sprint team members are presenting which sections?
{% endKeyQuestions %}

## Wrapping up the sprint with your client

### Overview

Hey ‚Äî you did a great job! That was a lot of work, but y‚Äôall DID IT! Give yourself a moment to breathe. Take time with the team to celebrate the work. Now let‚Äôs move on to the next step: handing off all the stuff the team generated.

Decide with your client on where things should live on their drives **before** the handoff. This helps avoid clients reaching out weeks down the road with ‚Äúhey where‚Äôs that thing and how do I login?‚Äù It‚Äôs your job to equip them before moving on.

- **Files and folders**. You may be integrated into the client ecosystem at this point (Sharepoint, Google Drive, Coda) and already have access to the folders you‚Äôll need to pop everything into. Make sure folders are clearly labeled, and the hierarchy makes sense if there are multiple layers. And make sure the client has access to whatever platform you choose. For example, some government agencies can‚Äôt access Google, so you wouldn‚Äôt want to leave a file there if that‚Äôs the case.
- **For software as a service (SaaS) solutions, whiteboards or prototypes**, share ownership or transfer to a client-run account if built with your accounts. Or save as a pdf.
- **Provide a documentation Read Me** (via Google Docs or email) on where everything lives ‚Äî folders, URLs, login credentials, etc. ‚Äî and confirm that the client can access everything.
- **Do not include PII and raw notes from interviews** in your handoff documentation unless you have agreed this is the right thing to do with your client.

This is also a good time to create and share a participant memo with all those who talked to us. The memo details our key findings, recommendations, and next steps. This memo is very important to us, as it allows for us to be transparent with those who made our research possible.

{% Checklist %}
For the product and delivery manager (PDM):
<br>
- Agree with the client ahead of time on where final artifacts and documents will live
- Double-check that PII is not included in deliverables
- Make sure clients actually test their login and access so they are sure they can access everything they need 
{% endChecklist %}

{% Checklist %}
For the researcher or the owner of the deliverable:
<br>
- Retitle documents so it‚Äôs clear what they are, and remove any confusing or extraneous information from the filename (like COPY OF or ‚Äî REV3, for example)
- Remove personally identifiable information (PII) about research participants from record files. Note that in many software suites (including Google Docs) there is a built-in revision history for files. Double-check that PII is not included in the revision history or copy and paste the scrubbed text into a new document.
- Share or exchange ownership of live files (Google Docs, slides, etc.)
- If you‚Äôve been working within the client ecosystem, save copies of all files to a Bloom internal project folder (unless there‚Äôs a contractual reason not to)
- Create and send out a participant memo to all participants
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- Have you identified where final deliverables will live?
- Have you used file formats the client prefers? Some clients may prefer Word to Google Docs, for instance.
- Have you cleaned your files of any PII or unnecessary or unintentional artifacts? Remember and double check the consent files to make sure you are doing what you promised for your participants.
{% endKeyQuestions %}

## Debrief with the team

### Overview

Honor all the work you did by making space to close out the project. Debriefing on all the work, or holding a full project retro, can help the team reflect on what went well and how to improve future sprints.

Generally, full project retros will focus on a few key open questions: 
- What went well: anything you want to celebrate, uplift, or carry forward
- What didn‚Äôt go well: honest reflection of the challenges, how they were overcome, and ways to mitigate against them in the future
- What would you do differently: what you would improve or change next time

It can also be helpful to have explicit space for:
- Appreciations: share specific thanks and kudos for your colleagues - it‚Äôs always nice to get positive feedback!
- Action items: how to make the learnings from the retro actionable

Teams can use different tools to manage retros. We like EasyRetro and Figjam.

Depending on the size of the team, dynamics, and challenges faced throughout the project, consider setting some ground rules or norms before starting the retro. This might be about how to manage time, how to take notes, and how to handle topics that need extra time.

üí° **Tip:** Remember to highlight the wins. And talk about why and what you could learn from them.

{% Checklist %}
For the product and delivery manager (PDM):
<br>
- Hold a retro with the full team. Have someone not on the project facilitate if they can.
- With the engagement manager (EM), synthesize the retro to identify how to take forward the learnings and action items.
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- Who will facilitate the final retro? Do all team members have a chance to participate? 
- How will you use the lessons in the future?
- Are there any project or team dynamics that will require extra time or care for discussion?
{% endKeyQuestions %}

## Package everything up, close out, and share

### Overview

After the project has wrapped up with the client, there are several steps we take to close it out internally.

This is also a great time to share the results and learnings from the project. Sharing the work you've done is often the best way to reflect on important insights to carry into future projects. We may also write case studies and share the work in internal project-sharing meetings.

Seek out other opportunities to share with the wider community. This could be a blog post, conference presentations, or other public forum.

{% Checklist %}
For the full sprint team:
<br>
- If you have sensitive data or files, make sure they are free from PII
- Identify ways to reflect on the work and share lessons learned
{% endChecklist %}

{% Checklist %}
For the engagement manager (EM), with assistance from the product and delivery manager (PDM) and team:
<br>
- Make sure your internal storage method has all final draft deliverables and key project documents that you have permission to save. All documents should have a clear and identifiable file naming convention.
- Seek written confirmation from the client that you have met all contractual deliverables.
