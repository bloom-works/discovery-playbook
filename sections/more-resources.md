## Common terms

These are some common terms used in this document and in practice.

We’ve kept the definitions short for simplicity, but many of these terms are connected to extensive research or have different layers of meaning. If there’s any uncertainty, it’s always good to double check with others on how they’re using these terms.

**affinity mapping:** A visual tool for organizing data into similar groups.

**artifacts:** Documents, slide decks, or individual graphics that represent work done in the discovery sprint. These are typically called “artifacts” or “assets” that can be combined into a single “deliverable.”

**co-design:** A process that invites participants into the design process as lived experts.

**consequence scanning:** A framework or process for finding how a product or design could impact others around it.

**cross-culture competence:** Being able to understand, respect, and communicate effectively with people from different cultures, so that all participants feel comfortable and safe.

**moderator guide:** Or interview guide, is a guide that includes the purpose of the interview, introductory scripts and key questions to ensure the participant is comfortable and the conversation covers interview goals.

**project brief:** A place to capture foundational project information. This doc may contain the problem statement, goals, stakeholder and partner role definitions, potential research participants, assumptions, boundaries, and other project-specific information.

**retro or retrospective:** A specific time set aside (often at the end of a 1- or 2-week chunk of work, or at the end of the sprint) to discuss and reflect on what went well and what things a team can improve on in the future.

**service design:** Looking holistically at how things happen at an organization. Service design generally focuses on internal processes to improve the experience of staff and indirectly improve the experience of the end users.
