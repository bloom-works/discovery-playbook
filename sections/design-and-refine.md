## Interpret, synthesize, and develop findings

### Overview

Synthesizing is what transforms all the data you have collected into patterns that can lead to meaningful insights. Sorting and categorizing data identifies new relationships within the existing data. This allows us to understand the problem in different ways, which can lead to new insights. We often start synthesizing as we are collecting data, which is a great way to save time in the final stages.

Involve all team members and, if possible, your client. Having everyone on the same page brings in every perspective and mitigates biases. At the least, do not synthesize alone as one person.

Use tools to help you organize and explore the data. Online whiteboarding tools like Figjam, Mural, and Miro allow you to arrange and group data points in different ways. They can help you identify patterns, trends, and relationships.

Make sure the tools you use can be accessed by the team working in this space. Team members or clients may have accessibility issues or be limited by government IT systems to what they can access.

Data synthesis is an iterative process. You may need multiple rounds of analysis to draw meaningful conclusions and generate realistic and actionable recommendations. You might want to hold follow-up interviews with participants or subject matter experts (SMEs) to test conclusions and confirm gaps. Allow enough time for review and refinement of the analysis as needed. This is why we recommend a week for synthesis at a minimum.

Some clients may prefer to stay hands-off or just want to read your insights. Others may want to take part in data analysis. In general, involve clients if possible. Their real-time feedback can help inform your deliverables. However, follow your documented decisions around protecting and anonymizing participant information. Your research subjects were honest with you, and you want to protect their privacy.

Typical synthesis frameworks include:
- Analyzing data to answer your research questions
- Identifying and prioritizing  pain points and moments that matter
- Identifying strengths to build on; what is working?
- Documenting policy requirements
- Mapping user experiences through journey maps, mapping  processes and creating service blueprints, diagramming technical architecture, mapping stakeholders
- Identifying quotes or clips from interviews that illustrate key points

Good conclusions consider stories and themes based on the greatest needs and number of people they will affect. **Revisit participant stories that led to surprising ‚Äúaha‚Äù moments or changed the team‚Äôs understanding of the problem**. A prioritization exercise can pull out the most impactful stories and themes.

Here‚Äôs an example of turning a story into a solid recommendation:
- **Story**: Kin caregivers that had legal support said how much of a positive difference it made and why
- **Recommendation**: Develop partnerships to provide independent, affordable legal support to kin families

Use a collaborative space like Figjam to discuss the most impactful stories and themes. Use the stories and themes as a base for drafting recommendations that are actionable and practical.

{% Checklist %}
For the product and delivery manager (PDM) and engagement manager (EM):
<br>
- Build in enough time in the schedule to interpret, analyze, and synthesize the collected data. Typically hold 3 days to a week at a minimum for this.
{% endChecklist %}

{% Checklist %}
For the researcher or PDM: 
<br>
- Assign a point person to lead the synthesis process
- Decide on the tools the team will use to synthesize data
- Be intentional about making the synthesis process a collaborative effort with the team
- Schedule multiple team synthesis sessions
- Verify if the recommendations overlap with or can get added to a current client program or service
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- Are you building in time as you go to interpret, analyze, and synthesize the data so you don't have to cram everything in at the end?
- Are the themes and sub themes in the synthesis process clear?
- Do your pulled notes, quotes, and summaries provide context? Or is there a risk that you‚Äôll misinterpret the data? 
- Are there any alternative explanations for the findings?
- Are there any potential biases in the data to address?
{% endKeyQuestions %}

## Draft recommendations

### Overview

Recommendations turn your conclusions into meaningful actions and changes based on your findings. Think about the gaps or pain points you found. Do any of them offer an opportunity for the client to make positive and actionable changes? The types of recommendations you develop might include (but not be limited to):
- building new tech solutions; 
- redesigning content on a website; 
- organizational change on internal or external processes; 
- augmenting staffing or contracts;
- advocating for policy changes;
- collaborating or connecting with certain stakeholders; or
- enabling data collection to better understand problems, bottlenecks, and performance.

Use "<a href="https://www.designkit.org/methods/how-might-we.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how might we</a>" questions as a prompt to turn insights into actions. This links your recommendations to the insights you‚Äôve uncovered. You may want to take this further. Ideation workshops can hold space for big picture thinking. From there, you can rank solutions and implement constraints.

To prioritize recommendations, consider which would have the biggest impact. Here are some ways to rank impact:
- Ease or speed of implementation
- Which pain points are addressed
- Who or how many people benefit 
- What reduces the cost of delay of something continuing on as is
- What resources the client has to act on suggestions near and longer term
- What requires coordination between departments and what action are highly autonomous
- What momentum can be generated

Consider <a href="https://doteveryone.org.uk/project/consequence-scanning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consequence scanning</a> to explore the intended and unintended consequences of recommendations.

It makes sense to provide multiple sets of recommendations or group out your recommendations. Some recommendations might be higher impact but harder-to-implement. Some might be lower impact but easier-to-implement. The actual best recommendation may be a mix of both. Give your clients a few ways to move forward.

Workshop draft recommendations with your client before you move onto final deliverables. This is an important pulse check on direction.

üí° **Tip:** Sometimes, research can be purely transactional. Your client may not want you to workshop recommendations, and that‚Äôs fine! Find an approach that works best for your client relationship.

{% Checklist %}
For the researcher, or full sprint team:
<br>
- Prioritize recommendations with an eye on impact and effort levels
- Consider your design constraints and any client limitations to keep in mind
- Get feedback on findings and emerging recommendations by workshopping ideas with the client
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- How can you turn the findings into actionable solutions?
- What recommendations can the client implement immediately and what might be long-term future work?
- What recommendations will deliver the highest impact?
- What time, effort, resources, and expertise do the solutions require?

## Make your deliverables as a team

### Overview

Your team has likely been sketching out what they have learned and ideas they have had throughout the sprint. Now it's time to refine them to illustrate your findings. As a team, you‚Äôll work together to identify which artifacts make the most sense to convey the story you‚Äôre trying to tell that aligns with the overarching goal. What's going to be most tangible and actionable.

Remember, we‚Äôre not delivering a definitive answer as a result of a discovery sprint. We‚Äôre providing context for what we‚Äôve learned and recommended next steps so our clients can take action.

Your final deliverables will typically consist of a few different elements. This could include documents, slide decks, or individual graphics. We refer to these as ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù or ‚Äúassets‚Äù that are combined into a single ‚Äúdeliverable.‚Äù

Typical deliverables generated during a discovery sprint can include:
- A sprint report, including an executive summary;
- A slide deck that you‚Äôll present;
- Maps (for example service, tech, or journey maps) and diagrams (technical flows, process flows);
- Competitive analysis;
- User archetypes;
- Lightweight prototypes and wireframes (if you're making a product recommendation).

What you‚Äôll actually develop will vary from sprint to sprint, but it‚Äôs usually some combination of the above.

üí° **Tip:** Remember that people with different usability needs might access artifacts now or in the future. Diagrams and virtual whiteboards are informative, but should complement plain-language text analysis.

{% Checklist %}
For the researcher, product and delivery manager (PDM), or other appropriate team member:
<br>
- Identify which concepts would be best to visualize in order to tell the story you want
- When possible, walk clients through potential artifacts so they can help identify what will appeal the most to the client
- Create artifacts that the client has the ability to take action on (these can be informed by ongoing conversations with the client)
- Make sure artifacts are accessible
{% endChecklist %}

{% KeyQuestions %}
- Which findings and recommendations are central to the story you‚Äôre trying to tell?
- What capabilities do you have on the team that‚Äôll enable you to make certain artifacts?
- What do you expect your client to do with the artifacts? What actions can they take?
- What problems are you illuminating? Why are you illuminating them?
