<!-- TODO: Style header 3 to look different than header 2 -->
### Phases

This playbook has 5 sections (or phases), just like a discovery sprint:

<!-- TODO: ADD LINKS to the "Prepare", "Define", "Discover", "Design & refine", "Deliver" sections -->
<ol>
    <li>Prepare -- Get everything you need to prepare for a sprint, leading up to kickoff.</li>
    <li>Define -- Gain an intimate understanding of the problem space. Start to create a plan to conduct discovery.</li>
    <li>Discover -- Time to get professionally curious! Find methods and techniques on how to conduct research and synthesis.</li>
    <li>Design & refine -- Take what you‚Äôve learned in discovery and begin to interpret findings and generate paths forward.</li>
    <li>Deliver ‚Äî Present to your clients, ship deliverables, and wrap up the sprint.</li>
</ol>

### Plays

Each phase is broken into "plays." Each play is a set of instructions on how to complete a sprint milestone. Each play includes:

<ul>
    <li>An <b>Overview</b> -- What‚Äôs the play, who‚Äôs involved, and how do you do it?</li>
    <li><b>Checklist</b> -- Things to remember, or activities to complete</li>
    <li><b>Key questions</b> -- Prompts for critical thinking and reflection</li>
</ul>

<!-- TODO: ADD LINKS to the "More resources" section -->
üí° Tip: If you find an unfamiliar word‚Äîor you‚Äôre just looking for a specific template‚Äîjump to the <b>More resources</b> section at the end of this playbook. In there, you‚Äôll find words that are commonly used in discovery sprints, plus useful links.

### Other things to know
This playbook is by no means exhaustive or set in stone. We chose the ‚Äúplaybook‚Äù format because it‚Äôs flexible and customizable. Discovery sprints are fast-paced, fluid, and vary in scope. If you need to run plays in different orders or add your own, we encourage that. In fact, most sprints aren‚Äôt linear and go back and forth between phases‚Äîthat‚Äôs OK!

We expect this document to expand and change as more people use it and provide feedback. So, if you learn something in your own sprints that you don‚Äôt see here, let us know! You can contact us at [hello@bloomworks.digital](mailto:hello@bloomworks.digital).

## What's a discovery sprint?

A discovery sprint is a time-bound, deep-dive investigation into a challenge or problem. Discovery sprints are conducted by a skilled and often cross-functional team. This work can be done in any sector, though at Bloom we most often partner with government agencies. The sprint team works with our client organization to learn about a problem or system. We bring expertise and a set of fresh eyes.
