title: About this playbook
---

This playbook is a field guide for people at Bloom Works—or anyone—to navigate a discovery sprint. It includes strategic, actionable guidance to make sprints successful. And it’s full of universal, human-centered approaches that apply to most sprints. 

## Where to start

Keep reading this section to get background on what a discovery sprint is, who’s involved, and key tips for making them successful.

### Phases

This playbook has 5 sections (or phases), just like a discovery sprint:

<!-- TODO: check that links to sections work -->
<ol>
    <li><a href="/sections/prepare/">Prepare</a> -- Get everything you need to prepare for a sprint, leading up to kickoff.</li>
    <li><a href="/sections/define/">Define</a> -- Gain an intimate understanding of the problem space. Start to create a plan to conduct discovery.</li>
    <li><a href="/sections/discover/">Discover</a> -- Time to get professionally curious! Find methods and techniques on how to conduct research and synthesis.</li>
    <li><a href="/sections/design_and_refine/">Design and refine</a> -- Take what you’ve learned in discovery and begin to interpret findings and generate paths forward.</li>
    <li><a href="/sections/deliver/">Deliver</a> — Present to your clients, ship deliverables, and wrap up the sprint.</li>
</ol>

### Plays

Each phase is broken into "plays." Each play is a set of instructions on how to complete a sprint milestone. Each play includes:

<ul>
    <li>An <b>Overview</b> -- What’s the play, who’s involved, and how do you do it?</li>
    <li><b>Checklist</b> -- Things to remember, or activities to complete</li>
    <li><b>Key questions</b> -- Prompts for critical thinking and reflection</li>
</ul>

<!-- TODO: ADD LINKS to the "More resources" section -->
💡 <b>Tip:</b> If you find an unfamiliar word—or you’re just looking for a specific template—jump to the <b>More resources</b> section at the end of this playbook. In there, you’ll find words that are commonly used in discovery sprints, plus useful links.

## Other things to know
This playbook is by no means exhaustive or set in stone. We chose the “playbook” format because it’s flexible and customizable. Discovery sprints are fast-paced, fluid, and vary in scope. If you need to run plays in different orders or add your own, we encourage that. In fact, most sprints aren’t linear and go back and forth between phases—that’s OK!

We expect this document to expand and change as more people use it and provide feedback. So, if you learn something in your own sprints that you don’t see here, let us know! You can contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@bloomworks.digital">hello@bloomworks.digital</a>.
