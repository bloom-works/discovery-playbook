title: About this playbook
---

This playbook is a field guide for people at Bloom Works‚Äîor anyone‚Äîto navigate a discovery sprint. It includes strategic, actionable guidance to make sprints successful. And it‚Äôs full of universal, human-centered approaches that apply to most sprints. 

## Where to start

Keep reading this section to get background on what a discovery sprint is, who‚Äôs involved, and key tips for making them successful. 

<!-- TODO: Style header 3 to look different than header 2 -->
### Phases

This playbook has 5 sections (or phases), just like a discovery sprint:

<!-- TODO: ADD LINKS to the "Prepare", "Define", "Discover", "Design & refine", "Deliver" sections -->
<ol>
    <li>Prepare -- Get everything you need to prepare for a sprint, leading up to kickoff.</li>
    <li>Define -- Gain an intimate understanding of the problem space. Start to create a plan to conduct discovery.</li>
    <li>Discover -- Time to get professionally curious! Find methods and techniques on how to conduct research and synthesis.</li>
    <li>Design & refine -- Take what you‚Äôve learned in discovery and begin to interpret findings and generate paths forward.</li>
    <li>Deliver ‚Äî Present to your clients, ship deliverables, and wrap up the sprint.</li>
</ol>

### Plays

Each phase is broken into "plays." Each play is a set of instructions on how to complete a sprint milestone. Each play includes:

<ul>
    <li>An <b>Overview</b> -- What‚Äôs the play, who‚Äôs involved, and how do you do it?</li>
    <li><b>Checklist</b> -- Things to remember, or activities to complete</li>
    <li><b>Key questions</b> -- Prompts for critical thinking and reflection</li>
</ul>

<!-- TODO: ADD LINKS to the "More resources" section -->
üí° Tip: If you find an unfamiliar word‚Äîor you‚Äôre just looking for a specific template‚Äîjump to the <b>More resources</b> section at the end of this playbook. In there, you‚Äôll find words that are commonly used in discovery sprints, plus useful links.

### Other things to know
This playbook is by no means exhaustive or set in stone. We chose the ‚Äúplaybook‚Äù format because it‚Äôs flexible and customizable. Discovery sprints are fast-paced, fluid, and vary in scope. If you need to run plays in different orders or add your own, we encourage that. In fact, most sprints aren‚Äôt linear and go back and forth between phases‚Äîthat‚Äôs OK!

We expect this document to expand and change as more people use it and provide feedback. So, if you learn something in your own sprints that you don‚Äôt see here, let us know! You can contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@bloomworks.digital">hello@bloomworks.digital</a>.

## What's a discovery sprint?

A discovery sprint is a time-bound, deep-dive investigation into a challenge or problem. Discovery sprints are conducted by a skilled and often cross-functional team. This work can be done in any sector, though at Bloom we most often partner with government agencies. The sprint team works with our client organization to learn about a problem or system. We bring expertise and a set of fresh eyes.

<b>The goal of a discovery sprint is to create a shared understanding with the client and make actionable recommendations. We‚Äôre not solving the challenge in this time frame.</b>

Discovery sprints are iterative and responsive in nature. They may not follow a direct, consistent path. There are some activities that occur in most, if not all, discovery sprints:

<ul>
    <li>The team interviews key stakeholders and users to learn as much as it can about the problem in a short amount of time. We encourage clients and stakeholders to participate.</li>
    <li>As research progresses, the team distills insights and synthesizes findings. The team should bring curiosity and empathy.</li>
    <li>Rather than re-emerging at the end of the sprint with a fully baked plan for the client - tada! - the team works closely with them throughout. And the team delivers findings and recommendations framed as actionable next steps.</li>
    <li>What the team finds and recommends is as important as how the team tells the story. A well-crafted narrative and artifacts like journey maps and technical diagrams show what the team learned.</li>
</ul>

### Who's involved

Throughout this playbook, we reference a few key groups of people.

<b>The sprint team:</b> This refers to the members of the Bloom team (or core team) that‚Äôs directly involved in the discovery sprint. This includes full-time staff and contractors. It sometimes includes members of other firms or organizations. 

Sprint teams typically include some combination of these roles:

<ul>
    <li>Engagement manager (EM)</li>
    <li>Sprint team lead </li>
    <li>Product and delivery manager (PDM)</li>
    <li>Researchers</li>
    <li>Designers</li>
    <li>Content strategists</li>
    <li>Tech strategists</li>
</ul>

We‚Äôll go over responsibilities of each role in the next section. Sprint teams work closely and collaboratively with the client, but they‚Äôre not included in our definition of ‚Äúthe sprint team.‚Äù

<b>The client:</b> This refers to the partner or the group receiving the deliverables at the end. We‚Äôll get more specific about roles within the client side later in this playbook.

<b>Participants:</b> These are all the people with relevant life experience who we invite to interview, participate in group workshops, or design solutions with us  (co-design).

<b>Stakeholders:</b> This generally refers to any person or group of people who has a vested interest in the outcomes of a discovery sprint. This could be a senior program leader or a frontline case manager.

## Scenarios and examples

At Bloom, these are some common types of discovery sprints we do:

<ul>
    <li>There‚Äôs a new digital service or program and the client wants to understand how to approach it before investing time and resources</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Example:</b> <a href="https://bloomworks.digital/washington-state-behavioral-health-strategic-plan-for-children-and-youth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can ground-level research inform the development of strategy and policy at scale?</a></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<!-- New lists for bullets so there is good spacing on page -->
<ul>
    <li>A service or program is not performing well, and the client wants to diagnose problems and provide a pathway to improvement‚Äîespecially in complex program ecosystems</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Example:</b> <a href="https://bloomworks.digital/a-path-to-fixing-unemployment-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A path to fixing unemployment insurance</a></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There‚Äôs a new policy or emergent user need, and a client wants to know the current status and how to respond</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Example:</b> <a href="https://bloomworks.digital/moving-toward-a-kin-first-model-of-child-welfare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moving toward a kin-first model of child welfare</a></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>A client is planning a procurement, and they want to define and scope a problem based on an up-to-date understanding of user needs and the product or technical state, and a recommendation for procurement</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Example:</b> <a href="https://bloomworks.digital/putting-agile-procurement-into-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Putting agile procurement into practice</a></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Timing and milestones

Every sprint will be a bit different. <b>This section shows typical milestones during a 6-week sprint.</b> It includes a week of preparation with the full sprint team. 

Adjust the timing of your milestones to fit the length and scale of your sprint engagement. Be aware there are always factors that will impact your timing. Some common ones: a large research participant pool, multiple participant groups, or hard-to-reach participants. Or, a project may be longer because it includes more than one research track.

<b>Note:</b> Some preparation happens before ‚Äúweek 0‚Äù in a sprint that we don‚Äôt elaborate on in this playbook. This includes setting up the contract with our client, budget, timeframe, staffing plan, and initial scope of work. At Bloom, we use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/182Q_oWEJHvrs1GPHSFwY6V84kwXlLdzQVVDLxR8xcoQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an internal project startup doc</a>üîí.

## Keys to success

We've identified a handful of tips that tend to make discovery sprints more successful. To maintain momentum (and not feel overwhelmed), come back to these keys to success.

#### 1. Stay focused on your goal

Define your guiding goal (or ‚Äúnorth star‚Äù) early and return to it often with the team. You want to build a <b>shared understanding</b> of a process, system, or service. Make sure everyone on the sprint team is moving intentionally toward that goal. 

#### 2. Remember your client and stakeholders are knowledgeable

Your client has likely been grappling with this problem space, possibly for years, and knows the lay of the land, what has been tried before, and who talks to who in the government agency. Be mindful of their expertise, learn from them, and push back respectfully as new data may surface.

#### 3. Don‚Äôt jump to a solution

<b>A discovery sprint is about trying to understand and frame the problem, not solve it!</b> Discovery sprint challenges are typically much too large or complex to consider solving in a handful of weeks. Instead, we spend our time identifying potential paths forward. Picking a solution too early can take away from understanding the problem, getting user perspectives, and moving within relevant constraints.

#### 4. Stay curious and flexible

Be The Sponge. Discovery sprints are about absorbing as much information as possible. New findings should shape and refine your understanding and your deliverables. Clients can and will shift things ‚Äî and that‚Äôs OK! Not only may clients shift, but <b>your own team‚Äôs assumptions, ideas, and theories can (and should!) shift as you gather more information.</b>

#### 5. Communicate, communicate, communicate

Share knowledge. Keep each other (and especially the client) up to date on new discoveries, brick walls you may hit, and pivots throughout the process. This can help you get to solutions more quickly and keep everyone aligned. Create intentional spaces for designing with each other and with the client. Check in on each other, especially during an emotionally taxing sprint or time ‚Äî we‚Äôre all human, after all.

#### 6. Budget time to dive deep into synthesis and decide on recommendations

It is common for collecting data during the discovery phase to eclipse the effort truly needed to review and synthesize findings. Be vigilant about holding time for this during the sprint process.

#### 7. Bake in time to be human with each other

Everyone has different needs, work styles, and approaches ‚Äî embrace it! Take the time to learn about each other and how to work together. Set up semi-regular activities (like ice breakers or casual coffee chats) and devoted time to debrief, reflect, and connect.

### Working with with diverse and marginalized populations
We aim to center the needs of people who rely on government services. This is a foundational part of our discovery sprint practice. Participants (people we interview, survey, or ‚Äúco-design‚Äù with) may include people who have been disadvantaged by unfair systems and structures. 

We center and uplift these perspectives while acknowledging the power we hold as researchers and designers. 

As humans, our default is to assume our own cultural lens when approaching our work. Acknowledging and learning about differences across cultures is an important aspect of how we can make participants feel comfortable, safe, and willing to engage. 

At Bloom, we practice cultural competence by being transparent with participants and taking a trauma-informed approach. Learn more about why and how we do this:
