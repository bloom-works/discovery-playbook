title: About this playbook
---

This playbook is a field guide for people at Bloom Worksâ€”or anyoneâ€”to navigate a discovery sprint. **It includes strategic, actionable guidance to make sprints successful**, and itâ€™s full of universal, human-centered approaches that apply to most sprints. 

## What you'll find in this playbook

For background on what a discovery sprint is, example scenarios and timelines, and key tips for making them successful, go to the <a href="/sections/about-discovery-sprints/">About discovery sprints</a> section.

<!-- TODO: Style header 3 to look more different than header 2 -->
### Phases

After the background information, youâ€™ll find 5 sections (or phases), just like a discovery sprint:

<ul>
    <li><a href="/sections/prepare/">Prepare</a> -- Get everything you need to prepare for a sprint, leading up to kickoff.</li>
    <li><a href="/sections/define/">Define</a> -- Gain an intimate understanding of the problem space. Start to create a plan to conduct discovery.</li>
    <li><a href="/sections/discover/">Discover</a> -- Time to get professionally curious! Find methods and techniques on how to conduct research and synthesis.</li>
    <li><a href="/sections/design-and-refine/">Design and refine</a> -- Take what youâ€™ve learned in discovery and begin to interpret findings and generate paths forward.</li>
    <li><a href="/sections/deliver/">Deliver</a> â€” Present to your clients, ship deliverables, and wrap up the sprint.</li>
</ul>

### Plays

Within each phase, youâ€™ll find several "plays." Each play is a set of instructions on how to complete a sprint milestone. Each play includes:

<ul>
    <li>An <b>Overview</b> -- Whatâ€™s the play, whoâ€™s involved, and how do you do it?</li>
    <li><b>Checklist</b> -- Things to remember, or activities to complete</li>
    <li><b>Key questions</b> -- Prompts for critical thinking and reflection</li>
</ul>

Discovery sprints are fast-paced, fluid, and vary in scope. If you need to run plays in different orders or add your own, we encourage that. In fact, most sprints arenâ€™t linear and go back and forth between phases â€” thatâ€™s OK!

ðŸ’¡ <b>Tip:</b> If you find an unfamiliar word â€” or youâ€™re just looking for a specific template â€” jump to the <a href="/sections/more-resources/">More resources</a> section at the end of this playbook. In there, youâ€™ll find words that are commonly used in discovery sprints, plus useful links.
